## Learning Objectives


* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables

## Requirements

* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
* Dont forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Tasks


### 0. push, pall 

* Implement the push and pall opcodes.
* The push opcode
* The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.


### 1. pint

* Implement the pint opcode.
* The pint opcode
* The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.


### 2. pop

* Implement the pop opcode.
* The pop opcode
* The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.


### 3. swap

* Implement the swap opcode.
* The swap opcode
* The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.


### 4. add

* Implement the add opcode.
* The add opcode
* The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.
